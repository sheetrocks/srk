# srk - the SheetRocks Command Line Interface

The first section of this tutorial will instruct you on how to push a custom formula to SheetRocks. The second section will show you how to write a custom formula. It will help to have programming experience.

Custom formulas can be written in Python, with future support coming for Go, Javascript, and R.

Some examples of what a custom formula could do:
- Reach out to an API and perform sentiment analysis on text within a sheet
- Pull and analyze financial data 
- Block senders from a sheet that pulls organization email
- Anything you can program!

# Uploading a Formula

## 1. Download the repository

Download or clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/sheetrocks/srk.git
```

## 3. Generate an API key

First, you'll need to log in and either create an API key or use an existing one. [Open SheetRocks](https://sheet.rocks/home) > log in > create a workbook > hover on Profile > click API keys > click Create API key. Copy the key to your clipboard.

<br/><br/>

## 5. Set your API key

On Mac:
```
export SRK_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

On Windows (Command Prompt):
```
setx SRK_TOKEN your_api_key_here
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```
$env:SRK_TOKEN="your_api_key_here"
```

On Linux:
```
export SRK_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

## 6. Push the example function to SheetRocks

Push the example formula located at `srk/examples/python/sumplusone` to SheetRocks.

On Mac:
```
srk.mac push /path/to/srk/examples/python/sumplusone/config.json
```

On Windows (Command Prompt):
```
srk.exe push /path/to/srk/examples/python/sumplusone/config.json
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```
srk.exe push /path/to/srk/examples/python/sumplusone/config.json
```

On Linux:
```
srk push /path/to/srk/examples/python/sumplusone/config.json
```

## 7. Success

If successful, you will see
```
ðŸŽ‰ Success! You have pushed your formula "SUMPLUSONE" to SheetRocks ðŸŽ‰
The formula is available for immediate use in a SheetRocks sheet.
```

## 8. Test your formula

Open a sheet in SheetRocks and try out your new formula

```
=SUMPLUSONE(enter_a_range_or_number)
```

<br/><br/>
# Troubleshooting pushing a formula

On a Mac you might receive the error message 

```
srk.mac cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified
```

To get around this, navigate to 

```
Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General
```

At the bottom of the window there should be a message that reads

```
srk.mac was blocked because it is not from an identified developer 
```

Hit `Allow Anyway` next to this message.


Run the `push` command again.
```
srk.mac push /path/to/srk/examples/python/sumplusone/config.json
```

Hit `open` when asked if you want to open `srk.mac`.

<br/><br/>

Itâ€™s possible that you might encounter some error messages as you are trying to follow the steps above. The errors should be descriptive enough to help you figure out whatâ€™s going on, but if you get stuck please contact support through the web-app and we can help you troubleshoot more!

# Writing Custom Formulas

## Creating a formula

Now that you know how to upload a custom formula, you can get to work creating your own.

For the purposes of this tutorial, there is a completed example in the `examples/python` folder. 
To make a new formula, follow the conventions of the example:
- The python formula must be called `calculate`
- The python function will be sent a list of arguments, cast as a spreadsheet castable type:
    * None (for empty cells)
    * float
    * string
    * datetime
    * bool
    * A two dimensional list of the primative types above (this represents a range such as A1:C3).
- The return value must be a spreadsheet castable type as defined above. If the output is a 2D list, it will overwrite
cells.

## Creating a help file

Please follow the supplied convention for help files. For reference see the `help_format.md` file in this directory and the completed example at `/examples/sumplusone/sumplusone.md`. 

- All `#` shown are required for headers. `---` is used to separate sections and is also required.

- The description for a formula must start with `Returns`.

- Optional arguments are enclosed in brackets [] and should specify default value if not given.

- In the `## Examples` section, you may include an `EXAMPLE_RANGE` that will format to appear as a spreadsheet snippet, with the top left most value appearing in cell `A1`. You can then reference these cells in your examples to show how the formula would be used in a sheet.

- In the `## Related Formulas` section, urls should be formatted as `formulas/relatedformulaname`.

## Creating a config file

You must include with your formula and help document a `config.json` file. This file includes metadata about your formula and the paths to the required files. See `/templates/config_template.json` for the template and `/examples/python/sumplusone/config.json` for a completed example.
